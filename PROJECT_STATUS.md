## 🔌 Port Allocations

### Current Allocations (WSL → Docker)
| Service | WSL Host | Docker Port | Status | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| ChromaDB | localhost:8001 | 8000 | ✅ Running | HTTP API access |
| MCP Server | via wrapper | Internal | ✅ Running | FastMCP via docker exec |

### WSL Integration Strategy
- **Access Method**: Wrapper scripts using `docker exec`
- **Port Forwarding**: Docker Compose handles WSL → container mapping
- **Protocol**: FastMCP via stdin/stdout through docker exec
- **Architecture**: Simplified - FastMCP eliminates need for HTTP proxy

## 📝 Notes & Context

### Migration Context
Successfully migrated Chroma MCP Server from Windows to WSL2. Docker containers are operational and accessible through wrapper scripts. File permissions have been resolved, main remaining challenge is HTTP proxy health check.

### Key Migration Decisions
- **Container Strategy**: Keep Docker containers, use wrapper scripts for WSL access
- **Access Method**: `docker exec` via wrapper scripts instead of direct WSL execution
- **Port Strategy**: Maintain same port mappings, leverage Docker port forwarding
- **Environment**: WSL2 with Docker Desktop integration

### WSL-Specific Considerations
- Docker integration works well with WSL2
- Wrapper script approach provides clean MCP integration
- Performance should be equivalent to native Linux
- Git repository preserved from Windows migration

- ✅ **Template Research**: Located and analyzed FastMCP template from qdrant vector database
- ✅ **Architecture Redesign**: Implemented clean separation of concerns
  - Created `ChromaConnector` business logic class for all ChromaDB operations
  - Created `ChromaMCPServer` class following FastMCP template pattern
  - Implemented proper 4-step initialization order (settings → business logic → FastMCP parent → tools)
- ✅ **Complete Tool Migration**: Refactored all 19 MCP tools to use modern patterns
  - Added `Context` parameters for structured debugging
  - Implemented `Annotated` types with `Field` descriptions for automatic validation
  - Moved tool functions inside `setup_tools()` method following template
  - Updated tool registration using `self.tool()` pattern
- ✅ **Quality Improvements**:
  - Full Pydantic type safety and parameter validation
  - Better error handling with structured initialization
  - Debugging support via context parameters
  - Clean separation between ChromaDB operations and MCP protocol

**Technical Details:**
- **Code Reduction**: 1439 → 1218 lines (15% reduction) while adding functionality
- **Architecture Pattern**: Business logic separated from MCP protocol handling
- **Type Safety**: All parameters now use Pydantic validation
- **Debugging**: Context-aware logging with `ctx.debug()` throughout
- **Template Compliance**: Following battle-tested FastMCP patterns for production reliability

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ **Server Instantiation**: ChromaMCPServer creates successfully with all dependencies
- ✅ **Tool Registration**: All 19 tools properly registered and accessible
- ✅ **MCP Protocol**: Server responds correctly to MCP requests
- ✅ **Collection Operations**: Verified with `chroma_list_collections` returning full collection list
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

**Benefits Achieved:**
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation makes future enhancements easier
- **Type Safety**: Automatic parameter validation prevents runtime errors
- **Debugging**: Structured logging improves troubleshooting capabilities
- **Performance**: Following proven patterns optimizes resource usage
- **Future-Proof**: Modern architecture supports easier feature additions

**Docker Streamable HTTP Implementation & Cleanup**: Successfully implemented MCP-compliant streamable HTTP server in Docker container on port 10550. Deprecated legacy chroma-http-proxy and resolved container startup issues through systematic debugging. Added FastAPI/uvicorn dependencies, fixed import paths, and validated full MCP functionality. Cleaned up development containers (wizardly_jang, jolly_sanderson) leaving clean production stack. HTTP interface now provides JSON-RPC access to all 17 MCP tools with proper health checks and stability.
